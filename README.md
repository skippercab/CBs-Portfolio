# Christopher Bell's Portfolio
A collection of projects made over time in my Computer Science career. 
Last update to Resume - Winter 2018/19.

Note - More will be added to this on May 1 when I finish Computer Architecture, Database Management, and User Interface Design. Currently working on projects in all 3. This is also when I will update resume to include new grade average and other achievements. 

Project's I am currently working on:
  - Computer Architecture - I'm building a 32-MIPS Single Cycle Processor in verilog along with another pipelined version.
  - Database Management - Creating a multi-veriable database in SQL that involves many different dependencies and tables that are all intertwined with each other. 
  - User-Interface Design - Creating a mock-website for a non-profit 5k sign up, including full user registration and database integration, along with HTML and Ruby coding.
