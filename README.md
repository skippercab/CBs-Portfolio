# CBs-Portfolio
A collection of projects made over time in my Computer Science career. 
Last update to Resume - Winter 2018/19.

Note - More will be added to this on May 1 when I finish Computer Archetecture, Database Management, and User Interface Design. Currently working on projects in all 3. This is also when I will update resume to include new grade average and other achievements.
