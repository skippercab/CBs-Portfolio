======== PROJECT BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT ========

The class project is designed to reinforce the material learned in class and to ensure the student has a working level knowledge of at least one database tool. The student will develop a system that is used by a manufacturer to cost and price inventory items related to a manufactured product.

======= PROJECT RESULT =======

Our program was a success with Dr. Sessions being very impressed with our documentation and final product, as the final product was "nicely done, has good data, and the application appears to work properly."
